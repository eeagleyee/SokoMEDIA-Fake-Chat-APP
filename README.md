Overview of the Backend Implementation:

Server Setup (Node.js and Express.js):

The backend server was implemented using Node.js and utilizes the Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.

Database (MongoDB):

MongoDB serves as the primary database for the application, storing essential information related to posts, users, likes, etc.

Authentication and Authorization:

User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing a secure mechanism for user sessions.
Authorization is managed through bearer tokens included in the headers of authenticated requests, ensuring controlled access to protected resources.

Routes and Controllers:

The backend defines comprehensive routes to handle various HTTP methods and URL paths, promoting a modular and organized structure.
Dedicated controllers encapsulate the logic associated with each route, promoting separation of concerns.

Post Routes:

Specific routes are established for creating new posts, retrieving posts, and managing likes on posts.
Images linked to posts are stored and retrieved, leveraging MongoDB GridFS to handle potential large file storage.

User Routes:

User-centric routes handle actions such as user registration, login, and fetching user data, ensuring seamless user management.

Middleware:

Middleware functions play a crucial role in executing actions before or after a request reaches the route handler. For instance, JWT verification middleware adds an extra layer of security.

Error Handling:

A robust error-handling mechanism, possibly in the form of middleware, is in place to catch and appropriately respond to errors that may occur during request processing.

File Uploads:

The backend incorporates a file upload feature, potentially utilizing libraries like multer or gridfs-stream for efficient handling of large files.

Static File Serving:

Express.js was configured to serve static files, such as images, potentially from a dedicated directory on the server, ensuring optimal performance.

Deployment Configuration:

The backend boasts configurations tailored for different environments (development, production) and deployment settings, facilitating smooth deployment processes.

This overview provides a comprehensive understanding of the key components and functionalities implemented in the backend, emphasizing modularity, security, and scalability.
